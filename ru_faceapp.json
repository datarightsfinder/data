Communications between you and FaceApp. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.\n\nAnalytics information:\n\nWe use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.\n\nCookies and similar technologies:\n\nWhen you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use FaceApp and provide features to you.\n\nWe may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.\n\nLog file information:\n\nLog file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.\n\nWhen you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.\n\nDevice identifiers:\n\nWhen you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by FaceApp.\n\nA device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.\n\nMetadata:\n\nMetadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.\n\nUsers can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you share a photo) or other data."

Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.\n\nWe may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners.

You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.\n\nResponding to legal requests and preventing harm:\n\nWe may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
